# Zelora

Zelora is a simple system designed to support a basic e-commerce workflow by allowing the admin to record all products and manage carts through a dedicated admin dashboard.

This application is developed to meet the requirements of my technical test as part of the selection process for Frontend Engineer role at Bosshire.
